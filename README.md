# Stock Price Prediction using Feature Engineering and Random Forest Regressor

This Python script demonstrates how to predict stock prices by employing feature engineering with lag features and training a Random Forest Regressor model.

## Instructions

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install the required Python libraries using the following command:

   ```shell
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Code Directory**:
   - Change your working directory to the directory containing the code:

   ```shell
   cd stock-price-prediction
   ```

4. **Run the Code**:
   - Execute the Python script to load the 'MSFT.csv' dataset, preprocess the data, perform feature engineering, train the Random Forest Regressor model, and evaluate it:

   ```shell
   python stock_price_prediction.py
   ```

5. **View Results**:
   - The script will display the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for model evaluation.
   - A visualization of actual vs. predicted stock prices will be shown.
